The Lower House may be dissolved at any time by the Emperor on the advice of the Prime Minister.

After the committee votes on the bill, it is passed for approval to Diet plenary session in both houses. If the two chambers votes are at odds, a conference committee is convened in an attempt to reach a compromise. After a law is passed it is promulgated by the Emperor and announced in the government gazette.

The three branches of governmental power are the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. The 1991 Constitution is the source and origin of all laws and it overrides them all. The legislative power is vested in a bicameral Congress composed of a Senate, with 102 members, and a House of Representatives with 163 members. Senators and Representatives are elected to four year-terms and may be re-elected for indefinite terms.

The president of each committee assigns one or more members to act as bill sponsors and present a report to the committee (also published in the Congressional Gazette).The bill is then debated, amended, voted on and, if approved, submitted to the plenary of each chamber. The bill is assigned one or more sponsors in the plenary session where again it will be debated. The chamber may decide to send the bill back to the committee whenever its text becomes significantly different from the one originally submitted. Once the bill is approved by one chamber, it will undergo the same process in other chamber.

The CO2 Act set an emission reduction objective of 10% for CO2 emissions for the period 2008-12 compared to 1990 levels (CO2 emissions represent around 80% of Switzerland's GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol). It contained a number of policy measures, which were further specified in action plans, programmes and policies and have been amended based on the changes to the CO2 Act since 2000. Those include:\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e- CO2 levy for thermal fuels\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e- Climate cent on transportation fuels\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e- Voluntary commitments\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e- Cross-cutting measures in areas suitable to climate policy integration\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e- Use of cap and trade market mechanisms and flexible mechanisms - Requires the Federal Council to propose further GHG emission reduction targets for period after 2012 leading up to 2020.\u003c/div\u003e&quot;,&quot;law_id&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;co2-act-act-641-71-fully-revised-version&quot;,&quot;geography_id&quot;:174,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2019-12-08T17:46:22.795Z&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2020-12-04T15:29:03.388Z&quot;,&quot;visibility_status&quot;:&quot;published&quot;,&quot;created_by_id&quot;:null,&quot;updated_by_id&quot;:5,&quot;discarded_at&quot;:null,&quot;legislation_type&quot;:&quot;legislative&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:null,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-11-25&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;\u003ca href=\&quot;/geographies/switzerland/laws/co2-act-act-641-71-fully-revised-version\&quot;\u003eCO2 Act (Act 641.71, fully revised version)\u003c/a\u003e&quot;,&quot;short_description&quot;:&quot;On November 25, 2020, the Federal Council adopted the revised CO2 ordinance, which is scheduled to enter into force on January 1, 2021.

The government, parliament and courts are organised across the federal level, the cantonal level and the communal level. There is a strong tradition of subsidiarity in the form of cantonal and communal self-determination and self-governance. The federal level aims to establish a minimal amount of national standards and holds responsibility for supra-cantonal policy areas. In consequence, constitutional law states that legislative power rests with the sovereign cantons unless it is explicitly assigned to the federal level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;\u003eThe Swiss Parliament consists of two legislative chambers. The 200 members of the National Council are elected every four years based on a refined proportional representation system with modifications for smaller cantons. The last federal election was held in October 2015 and the next will be held in 2019. The cantons are represented in the second chamber, the Council of States. Its 46 members represent the 20 full cantons (two representatives each) and the 6 half cantons (one representative). The two chambers discuss new laws separately in an iterative process until an agreement can be reached. Because representing a constituency in the Parliament is not a full-time job, parliament meets only 4 times per year for several weeks. The meetings are supplemented with one-day conferences of the different commissions, where members of parliament represent their parties interests. The seven members of the federal government form the Bundesrat (Federal Council). As heads of government departments they hold equal rights and can be re-elected without legal limit to their total term of office. They meet weekly and take decisions either by majority voting or consensus. At the beginning of a new four-year term, the Federal Assembly consisting of the National Council and the Council of States elects the Federal Council in the December following the parliamentary election (and the frequently jointly held Council of States election). The Swiss Presidency rotates among the members of the Federal Council each year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;\u003eDirect democracy plays a crucial role in the legislative process. There are frequent referenda on laws passed by the Parliament, some mandatory while others are discretionary if 50,000 citizens demand for it. Citizens can also submit proposals to change the Swiss constitution if supported by 100,000 signatures. The relatively small population and long tradition of direct democracy have so far had a stabilising effect on Swiss politics as they increase parties willingness to compromise, favour large coalitions and are likely to block extreme laws.\u003c/p\u003e&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2019-11-25T11:44:44.450Z&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2020-02-27T14:26:16.962Z&quot;,&quot;visibility_status&quot;:&quot;published&quot;,&quot;created_by_id&quot;:null,&quot;updated_by_id&quot;:null,&quot;discarded_at&quot;:null,&quot;percent_global_emissions&quot;:&quot;0.1&quot;,&quot;climate_risk_index&quot;:&quot;52.33&quot;,&quot;wb_income_group&quot;:&quot;High income&quot;,&quot;eu_member&quot;:false},&quot;date_passed&quot;:&quot;2013&quot;,&quot;last_change&quot;:&quot;November, 2020&quot;,&quot;legislation_type_humanize&quot;:&quot;Legislative&quot;,&quot;geography_path&quot;:&quot;/geographies/switzerland&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:9739,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;An EU Strategy to harness the potential of offshore renewable energy for a climate neutral future (&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;\u003cdiv\u003eThis communication from the Commission establishes an EU strategy to \&quot;make offshore renewable energy a core component of Europes energy system by 2050\&quot;.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe document analyses the potential of its offshore basins and each offshore renewable energy technology: floating PV, tidal energy, wave energy, floating wind and offshore wind.

Most often, the Commission proposes new legislation, but it is the Council and Parliament together that pass the laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;\u003eThe main forms of EU legislation are directives, regulations and decisions. Directives and regulations can be adopted by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament or by the Commission alone. A regulation is a general measure that is binding in all its parts, directly appli­cable in the Member States and addressed to everyone. A directive, on the other hand, is addressed to the member states. It is binding as to the result to be achieved, but leaves member states to choose the form and method they adopt to achieve it. The Commission is required to verify that member states transpose correctly and in due time the directives that have been adopted and can sanction them if they fail to do so. Decisions are EU laws relating to specific cases. They can be adopted by the Council (sometimes jointly with the European Parliament) or by the Commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;\u003eThe Commission can also publish Action Plans, White Papers, Green Papers, Commission regulations and Communications. An Action Plan serves to detail actions needed to reach the goals set in individual directives. A White Paper sets out the Commissions policy programme in a specific area. Before a White Paper is written, a Green Paper is published, which is a consultative document including suggestions and options for new policy. Each single proposal for legislation announced in a White Paper or deriving from a policy initiative announced in it is subject to one or more rounds of open consultation and an impact assessment. White Papers, Green Papers and Communications can serve to identify future legislative proposals. Commission regulations primarily serve as administrative acts on the functioning of the EU Institutions. The Treaty of Lisbon (2009) created a new category of legislation, Delegated Acts, by which, under strict conditions, the legislator can delegate to the Commission the power to adopt acts amending non-essential elements of a legislative act, in particular to specify certain technical details.\u003c/p\u003e&quot;,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2019-11-25T11:44:43.374Z&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2019-11-25T11:44:43.374Z&quot;,&quot;visibility_status&quot;:&quot;published&quot;,&quot;created_by_id&quot;:null,&quot;updated_by_id&quot;:null,&quot;discarded_at&quot;:null,&quot;percent_global_emissions&quot;:null,&quot;climate_risk_index&quot;:null,&quot;wb_income_group&quot;:null,&quot;eu_member&quot;:false},&quot;date_passed&quot;:&quot;2020&quot;,&quot;last_change&quot;:null,&quot;legislation_type_humanize&quot;:&quot;Executive&quot;,&quot;geography_path&quot;:&quot;/geographies/european-union&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:9734,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Royal Decree 960/2020 regulating the economic regime of renewable energy for electricity production facilities&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;\u003cdiv\u003eThis document sets the remuneration framework for the generation of electrical energy from renewable energy sources, called the economic regime of renewable energy (\&quot;régimen económico de energías renovables\&quot;), based on the long-term recognition of a price for energy.\u003c/div\u003e&quot;,&quot;law_id&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;royal-decree-960-2020-regulating-the-economic-regime-of-renewable-energy-for-electricity-production-facilities&quot;,&quot;geography_id&quot;:168,&quot;created_at&quot;:&quot;2020-11-16T15:58:40.307Z&quot;,&quot;updated_at&quot;:&quot;2020-11-16T16:00:51.183Z&quot;,&quot;visibility_status&quot;:&quot;published&quot;,&quot;created_by_id&quot;:5,&quot;updated_by_id&quot;:5,&quot;discarded_at&quot;:null,&quot;legislation_type&quot;:&quot;executive&quot;,&quot;parent_id&quot;:9468,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2020-11-03&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:&quot;\u003ca href=\&quot;/geographies/spain/policies/royal-decree-960-2020-regulating-the-economic-regime-of-renewable-energy-for-electricity-production-facilities\&quot;\u003eRoyal Decree 960/2020 regulating the economic regime of renewable energy for electricity production facilities\u003c/a\u003e&quot;,&quot;short_description&quot;:&quot;This document sets the remuneration framework for the generation of electrical energy from renewable energy sources, called the economic regime of renewable energy (\u0026quot;régimen económico de energías renovables\u0026quot;), based on the long-term recognition of a price for energy.&quot;,&quot;geography&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:168,&quot;geography_type&quot;:&quot;national&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;ESP&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Spain&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;spain&quot;,&quot;region&quot;:&quot;Europe \u0026 Central Asia&quot;,&quot;federal&quot;:false,&quot;federal_details&quot;:null,&quot;legislative_process&quot;:&quot;\u003cp style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;\u003eSpain is a Parliamentary Monarchy.

Both Chambers convene in Plenary Sessions and in Commissions. Assemblies of the Autonomous Communities may ask the government to adopt a bill or send an act of proposal to the Board of the Congress. Popular initiatives require at least 500,000 signatures and cannot introduce legislation dealing with issues reserved to Organic Laws or regarding taxes, international affairs and the prerogative of pardon.
